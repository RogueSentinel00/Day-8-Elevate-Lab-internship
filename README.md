. Browsing Test:

  Accessed websites like google.

  All traffic was encrypted via HTTPS, and browsing was successful without geo-restrictions or DNS leaks.

. Performance Comparison:

  With VPN: Slightly slower browsing and streaming due to encryption and rerouting.

  Without VPN: Faster speeds and lower latency but with real IP exposure.

6. Research on VPN Encryption:

    VPNs encrypt data using protocols like OpenVPN, IKEv2, or WireGuard.

    Encryption ensures secure data transit, protects from eavesdropping on public Wi-Fi, and masks user location/IP.

VPN Benefits:

  Hides real IP address and location.

  encrypts internet traffic, improving security.

  Bypasses geographic restrictions and censorship.

  Protects users on public Wi-Fi networks.

  Prevents ISP tracking and throttling.

VPN Limitations:

  Free VPNs may have slower speeds, limited servers, or data caps.

  Not all VPNs follow strict no-log policies (some may sell data).

  Doesnâ€™t protect against malware or phishing (requires additional tools).

  Some websites may block VPN traffic.
